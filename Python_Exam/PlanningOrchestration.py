# AGENT ORCHESTRATION FOR CLOUD ARCHITECTURE PLANNING

"""
SCENARIOS CHOSEN:
1. Simple E-commerce Site
2. Customer Support Chatbot

--------------------------------------------------------
QUESTION 1: AGENT DESIGN (20 points)

Agent 1: Requirements Analyst
- Role: Break down business requirements into technical needs
- Input: Problem description + business context
- Output: List of functional requirements, expected load, compliance needs
- Collaboration: Sends structured requirements to Architecture Designer agent

Agent 2: Architecture Designer
- Role: Translate requirements into high-level cloud architecture components
- Input: Structured requirements from Requirements Analyst
- Output: Suggested architecture diagrams, component selection (compute, storage, networking)
- Collaboration: Passes proposed architecture to Cost & Feasibility Evaluator and Security & Compliance Agent

Agent 3: Cost & Feasibility Evaluator
- Role: Estimate cost, performance feasibility, and scalability
- Input: Architecture proposal + usage estimates
- Output: Cost report, scalability analysis, resource bottlenecks
- Collaboration: Feedback to Architecture Designer if budget/scale is unfeasible

Agent 4: Security & Compliance Agent
- Role: Validate architecture for security best practices, compliance, and risk mitigation
- Input: Architecture proposal
- Output: Security checklist, compliance suggestions, potential risks
- Collaboration: Sends alerts back to Architecture Designer for modifications

Agent 5: Integration & Monitoring Agent (Optional)
- Role: Ensure compatibility with existing systems, monitoring, and observability
- Input: Final architecture proposal
- Output: Integration plan, monitoring setup recommendations, logging requirements

--------------------------------------------------------
QUESTION 2: ORCHESTRATION WORKFLOW (25 points)
Scenario: Simple E-commerce Site

1. Input: Business owner submits problem statement
2. Requirements Analyst: Extract functional requirements, estimate load, output structured requirements
3. Architecture Designer: Map requirements to cloud components, produce draft architecture
4. Cost & Feasibility Evaluator: Calculate costs, check performance, suggest adjustments
5. Security & Compliance Agent: Validate architecture security, compliance, recommend modifications
6. Iteration: Architecture Designer updates proposal based on feedback until requirements met
7. Integration & Monitoring Agent: Designs monitoring, logging, alerting, ensures integration
8. Output: Final recommendation report + architecture diagram + cost/security checklist

Failure Handling:
- If an agent fails or returns unclear output, orchestrator flags step, retries, or requests clarification

--------------------------------------------------------
QUESTION 3: CLOUD RESOURCE MAPPING (20 points)
Scenario: Simple E-commerce Site

Compute:
- Containers (AWS ECS / Fargate) for backend â†’ scalable, cost-efficient
- Serverless functions (AWS Lambda) for lightweight tasks (email, image resize)

Storage:
- Relational DB (AWS RDS PostgreSQL) for products, orders, users
- Object Storage (AWS S3) for images/media
- Caching (Redis / ElastiCache) for frequently accessed data

Networking:
- API Gateway for REST API routing
- Load Balancer to distribute traffic
- CDN (CloudFront) for static content/images

Security & Monitoring:
- IAM roles for permissions
- Encryption (at rest and in transit)
- CloudWatch / CloudTrail for logs, monitoring, auditing

Justification:
- Containers + serverless = scalability & cost efficiency
- Relational DB = transactional consistency
- Object storage + CDN = performance for media
- Security & monitoring = compliance & visibility

--------------------------------------------------------
QUESTION 4: REUSABILITY & IMPROVEMENT (15 points)

Standardize:
- Agent interfaces (inputs/outputs)
- Base architecture templates
- Security/compliance rules

Customize per project:
- Traffic/load estimates
- Specific integrations (payments, CRM)
- Budget constraints

Learning & Feedback:
- Log agent decisions, cost estimates, final choices
- Use historical data for future recommendations
- Stakeholder feedback to improve decisions

--------------------------------------------------------
QUESTION 5: PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS (20 points)

Conflicting recommendations:
- Orchestrator weighs trade-offs (cost vs. performance)
- Maintain confidence scores per agent output

Incomplete/vague problem statements:
- Agents prompt for clarification
- Apply defaults/conservative assumptions if unclear

Budget constraints:
- Evaluate multiple scenarios
- Suggest cheaper alternatives (serverless vs VM, caching strategies)

Integration with legacy systems:
- Integration Agent checks compatibility
- Suggest adapters/middleware if needed

Keeping up with cloud services/pricing:
- Maintain service catalog & price database
- Periodically refresh from cloud provider APIs

--------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY

The orchestration approach creates a modular multi-agent system where each agent specializes in a domain, collaborates via structured inputs/outputs, and iteratively produces a complete, secure, cost-efficient cloud architecture recommendation. It supports reuse across projects while allowing customization for business-specific requirements.
