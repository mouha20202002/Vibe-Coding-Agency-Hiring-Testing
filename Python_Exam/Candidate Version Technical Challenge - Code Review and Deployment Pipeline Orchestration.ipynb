    "You are tasked with creating an AI-powered system that can handle the complete lifecycle of code review and deployment pipeline management for a mid-size software company. The system needs to:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Current Pain Points:**\n",
    "- Manual code reviews take 2-3 days per PR\n",
    "- Inconsistent review quality across teams\n",
    "- Deployment failures due to missed edge cases\n",
    "- Security vulnerabilities slip through reviews\n",
    "- No standardized deployment process across projects\n",
    "- Rollback decisions are manual and slow\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business Requirements:**\n",
    "- Reduce review time to <4 hours for standard PRs\n",
    "- Maintain or improve code quality\n",
    "- Catch 90%+ of security vulnerabilities before deployment\n",
    "- Standardize deployment across 50+ microservices\n",
    "- Enable automatic rollback based on metrics\n",
    "- Support multiple environments (dev, staging, prod)\n",
    "- Handle both new features and hotfixes\n",
